Focus on the product development process: user stories, roadmap, data analysis, and presentation of findings.\n\n2. **CRM System Optimization Project (Process Improvement):**  Analyze the current CRM system (Salesforce or HubSpot, if familiar) at your current or previous company (if permissible). Identify areas for improvement and propose a plan for optimization, including A/B testing suggestions for increased user engagement and sales conversion.\n\n3. **Fintech Mobile App Feature Enhancement (Market Research & Strategy):** Analyze a successful fintech mobile app. Identify a potential new feature or improvement based on market research and user needs. Develop a detailed product roadmap, including prioritized features, release timelines, and potential risks/mitigation strategies.  Justify your choices with data and analysis.\n\n\n**4.

Remember to stay consistent, actively seek feedback, and continuously adapt your learning path based on your progress and the evolving needs of the product management field.  Your existing expertise provides a significant advantage \u2013 leverage it effectively and focus on bridging the gap with targeted technical and soft skills.\n", "timestamp": "2025-06-10T19:36:08.091775"}
